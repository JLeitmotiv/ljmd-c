Description:
-----------------------------------
This is a simple program for the simulation of Molecular Dynamics.
The C program is interfaces with python.

A) How to use?
-----------------------------------
1. Comile: First of all, it is needed to be compiled. 
to compile: 
	make

2. Go to python folder by typing:
	cd python

3. Run: this program is capable of taking 3 different types of input
from the user i.e, screen, file and GUI. to run screen type:
	./main.py
to input a file:
	./main.py -f <filename.inp>
	./main.py --file <filename.inp>
to use GUI:
	./main.py -g
	./main.py --gui

B) Format of input file with the extension *.inp :
-------------------------------------
natoms 108             # natoms
mass 39.948            # mass in AMU
epsilon 0.2379         # epsilon in kcal/mol
sigma 3.405            # sigma in angstrom
rcut 8.5               # rcut in angstrom
boxlength 17.1580      # box length (in angstrom)
restart argon_108.rest # restart
coord argon_108.xyz    # coord_output file
thermo argon_108.dat   # thermo_output
nsteps 10000           # nr MD steps
timestep 5.0           # MD time step (in fs)
print 100              # output print frequency
Andersen 95 0.1	       # thermostate 

** If you donot want to calculate Andersen thermostate leave the last
blank.

C) Files descriptions:
*.rest	: contain the information of restarting
*.xyz	: contain the position of the atoms with respect to time step
*.dat	: contain the output information of energies with respect to time
	  (Temperature, Kinetic, Potential and Total energy)

D) For help type:
	./main.py -h
	./main.py --help
